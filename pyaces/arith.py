"""
This code defines a set of functions and a class for performing operations related to prime numbers, modular arithmetic, and prime factorization. Its primary functionalities are as follows:

Functions:
1. extended_gcd(a: int, b: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
   - Computes the extended greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`, returning the GCD along with the coefficients `s` and `t` that satisfy the equation `a * s + b * t = gcd(a, b)`.

2. randinverse(intmod: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
   - Generates a random integer `a` that is coprime with `intmod` and computes its modular inverse using the extended GCD.

Class:
3. class Primes:
   - A class for managing prime numbers, including functionality to generate primes, cache results, perform prime factorization, and manage prime factors. The primary purpose of this class is to generate candidate `q` parameters used in the ACES cryptosystem.

Methods:
- Primes.__init__(self, upperbound: int, cache: bool = True):
   - Initializes the class, generates primes for numbers up to the given `upperbound`, and optionally caches the results.
   
- Primes.get_primes(upperbound: int, cache: list[int] = []) -> list[int]:
   - Generates a list of primes for numbers up to the given `upperbound`, leveraging any primes from the provided cache.

- Primes.factorize(self, n: int, limit: Optional[int] = None) -> Optional[dict[int, int]]:
   - Factorizes the integer `n` into its prime components using precomputed primes, returning a dictionary with prime factors and their multiplicities.

- Primes.add_units(self, n: int) -> None:
   - Adds a number and its prime factors to the `units` attribute, which is a dictionary used to store prime factors that should be excluded from the factorization of candidate `q` parameters.

- Primes.find_candidates(self, zero_divisors: list = []) -> list[dict[str,Any]]:
   - Finds candidate `q` parameters whose prime factorization does not include factors from the `units` attribute but contains primes from the `zero_divisors` list.
